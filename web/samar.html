            <span class="first-letter">T</span>he next few days were really challenging, we went over some new topics and discovered new ideas. As a consequence, things has seem to become more hard and it was hard for me to keep up at the same pace as I was in the first days. I needed a makeup. So I decided to talk with the lead mentor at Codi named “Samar” and she has managed to meet me on a video chat where we had lots of talk about how I can improve myself in different ways. She decided that the best way would be to give me extra practice exercises to work on alongside my tasks. I began to feel real pressure: “how am I gonna pass this?”.</p>
