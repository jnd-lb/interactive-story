            <span class="first-letter">O</span>n a day of February, I came back home late. I started doing the things I do in usual. I sat on dinner with my family, I had a quick nap and then watched some science discovery episodes about space. My family has always been a support for me, they’ve always motivated to make extra steps and move on. This has triggered me to start surfing the internet and explore more about this “dark-lighted” universe. I hovered over several sites and deepen into social media websites maybe I can find some nice people sharing my interest.

            All of the sudden, I stopped at some kind of advertisement. It was actually a Call for Application at some organization named “Codi”. This has really got my attention since I’ve really heard of it in an info session lately and wanted to hover over this new knowledge and get best practices.
